<li><b>About</b><br>The Frost orchestra is a group oƒ people who play instruments like violins and cellos, not bagpipes. It is ƒor all sorts oƒ players, but all players in the Frost orchestra share one thing; the dream oƒ being a better player! Now, joining the Frost orchestra is as simple as getting a instrument and bow, practice, and a sign-up sheet. We also have a trip in the spring where we go to a local theme park like King’s Dominion, Hershey Park, or Busch Gardens.Our teacher, Ms. Geiger, is teaching at frost for her first year, and Ms.Milligan has been teaching for 6 years, and 3 of those years here. The songs that the Concert Orchestra learns are Holiday songs before Winter Break, and pop songs in the spring.
<hr><br><li><b>How to join:</b> 
<br>
The Frost orchestra is an amazing group, but you do need certain things in order to join. You need a interest in music, naturally, as you're going to play it ƒor a while. You then need either a ƒull set oƒ a instrument and a bow, a rod with horsehair, or, the money to rent one oƒ each. Finally, you need to have a bit oƒ skill, as we don't practice things like "hot cross buns”(an easy song).<hr><br><li><b>Why to join:</b><br>Do you want a career in music? iƒ so, you should join the Frost concert orchestra, as it can be a stepping stone to your potential scholarship, and even a job! People who are interested in music need training in order to get good at it, and the Concert orchestra is a perƒect spot. We perƒorm in multiple concerts, so iƒ you want to join a oƒƒicial orchestra, then this can condition you to it. Ms. Geiger is a top-notch teacher, and she will gladly teach the orchestra and you! 
<br>You should want to join the frost orchestra for a insane amount of reasons, and here are just a few of them. When you're in the frost orchestra, it can be hard training to become a good musician, but it is truly rewarding. Joining the concert orchestra will teach you many things, like dedication, teamwork, and other things that can majorly shape your future. There is lots of evidence that playing a instrument will improve your motor skills, academic skills, happiness, it goes on and on...you understand that it does so much for you. You also have fun in the orchestra, we did mention that there are corny jokes and spring trips, maybe? Finally, you have a high chance of making some very good music, such as holiday and pop songs, which is pretty awesome.

<hr><br><li><b>Frost Auditions:</b><br>You do need to audition for any of the orchestra’s, so to find the proper place to have your skills grow. Auditions for joining orchestras are usually held by your teachers in late spring. A teacher from Frost will have you play any song of your choice, as to measure your best playing capacity. From here you may be selected to enter 5 orchestras, those being beggining, concert, intermezzo, symphonic, and the last, chamber orchestra. The order I listed the groups in was a list of the least skilled (beginning) and the most skilled (chamber). It is suggested that you practice for this, as this determines what orchestra you play in for the next school year.
</li> 
<hr><br><li><b>About the Teachers:</b><br>Michelle Milligan is an experienced teacher, having taught for 6 years,it being her third year teaching at Frost middle school. She has taught many students, and they are all skilled instrument players, among them, there are a few people with amazing chances at a musical career. She also is among countless people in Northern America in the opinion that the best movies are Disney ones.
	<br>Sarah Geiger is teaching for her first year at Frost middle school, and at schools in general. All of her students are  better at playing instruments, and it has only been a few months. Take the concert orchestra, for example; they looked in horror at “Carol of the Bells”, but now they play it as easily as one breathes. She enjoys teaching, and loves cracking corny jokes
</li>
<hr>
<hr><br><li><b>Fees:</b><br></li>When you join any orchestra, you have to pay a few fees for certain things, such as uniforms. When you join the orchestra, you need to pay a 25$ Course materials fee, which covers music books, instrument/instrument case accessories, method books, etc. The uniforms cost 65$, which, upon purchase, you will be sized and a uniform given to you, the purpose of which is to be worn at formal events with the orchestra, such as performances. If you are a bit short on money, the price can be reduced, if you talk to your teacher. You also need to pay a 10 dollars for a orchestra shirt, which looks fantastic. When concert orchestra goes on the spring trip to said location, you will need to pay a fine from anywhere between 110-150 dollars, that depending on the particulars of your journey.</li>
